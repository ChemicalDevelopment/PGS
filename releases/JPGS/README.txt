Thank you for downloading PGS!

A few quick links to get you started:
  * Project on github: https://github.com/ChemicalDevelopment/PGS
  * Wiki: https://github.com/ChemicalDevelopment/PGS/wiki
  * Scripting page: https://github.com/ChemicalDevelopment/PGS/wiki/Scripting
  * Any issues with the program? https://github.com/ChemicalDevelopment/PGS/issues

A few tips for getting started:
  * GPU's have been found to be much less efficient than CPUs in both sieving, but especially polynommial verification. We believe this is due to GPU memory access to large arrays, or malformed work group size. First time users should stick with the CPU.
  * Look at the wiki! Seriously, there is tons of great reference on there for all the features on PGS
